# mosquito-metatranscriptomics
Angel Martin Dominguez

This is a repository of the code used for the TFM Meta-transcriptomic analyses of mosquito microbiota regarding different malaria cases.

Some scripts are provisional but give a general idea of the workflow followed. 

There is software missing due to direct execution in terminal to verify performance and results, like kraken2 and humann3.
